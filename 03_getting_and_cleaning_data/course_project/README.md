## Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project
### Introduction
This repository has been created to make available the "Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project" for peer assesment

### Data Cleaning Script
I created one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following: 
  1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
  2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
  3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
  4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
  5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
  
### Codebook
I created the CodeBook.md which describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I performed to clean up the data .
